This is a console version of the Mandriva stuff installer,
with it you can install skype, AAC codecs and flash pÄºugin.
It is 100% working.

Clone it from git and run 'make' to build and generate the
binary code called get_stuff. 

Than just run it ./get_stuff
It will show you a simple interface and will do nothing 
without your persmission, it asks for each action.
